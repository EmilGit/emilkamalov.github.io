    "text": "I am a PhD researcher at the European University Institute, Florence. I study political behavior, violence, repressions and war-induced Russian emigration. I am interested in quantitative methods, experimental and surveys methods. Prior to EUI I was working as a junior research fellow at Ronald F. Inglehart Laboratory for Comparative Social Research and taught quantitative methods at Higher School of Economics and European University at Saint Petersburg.\nWith Ivetta Sergeeva, I am a co-founder and co-principal investigator of two survey projects: OutRush and ViolenceMonitor. OutRush is a panel survey of war-induced Russian emigrants who left Russia after 24 February, 2022. ViolenceMonitor is a series of intimate partner violence victimization surveys that took place in 2021 in Russia.\n\nInterests\n\nPolitical Behvaior\nViolence and Repressions\nExperiments\nSurvey Methods\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\nProjects\n\n\nPublications\n\nPeer-review articles\nStudying Public Opinion Among Migrants: Challenges and Opportunities.  Russian Analytical Digest, 2023, No. 292.
