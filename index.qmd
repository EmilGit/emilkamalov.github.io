I am a PhD researcher at the European University Institute, Florence. I study political behavior, violence, repressions and war-induced Russian emigration. I am interested in quantitative methods, experiments and surveys. I am a co-founder and co-principal investigator (together with Ivetta Sergeeva) of two survey projects: [OutRush](https://outrush.io/eng) and [ViolenceMonitor](https://violencemonitor.org/). OutRush is a panel survey of war-induced Russian emigrants who left Russia after 24 February, 2022. ViolenceMonito    r is a series of intimate partner violence victimization surveys that took place in 2021 in Russia.
