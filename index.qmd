I am a PhD researcher in the [Department of Political and Social Sciences](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/political-and-social-sciences) at the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu) (EUI), Florence. I study political behavior, violence, repressions and war-induced Russian emigration. I love statistics, experimental and surveys methods.

Prior to EUI I was working as a junior research fellow at [Ronald F. Inglehart Laboratory for Comparative Social Research](https://lcsr.hse.ru/en/) and taught quantitative methods at [Higher School of Economics](https://www.hse.ru/en/) (HSE) and [European University at Saint Petersburg](https://eusp.org/en). I received a Master's degree in Social Sciences from HSE, and a Bachelor's degree in Economics from a university in the middle of Russia. I also happen to have a [Candidate of Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidate_of_Sciences) degree in Social Philosophy.

Alongside [Ivetta Sergeeva](https://www.eui.eu/people?id=ivetta-sergeeva), I am a co-founder and co-principal investigator of two multi-wave survey projects: [OutRush](https://outrush.io/eng) and [ViolenceMonitor](https://violencemonitor.org/). OutRush is a panel survey of Russian emigrants who left the country due to war after February 24, 2022. ViolenceMonitor focuses on intimate partner violence and conducted victimization surveys in Russia in 2021. Both projects have received wide media coverage, both in Russia and internationally, from outlets such as [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fleeing-putin-thousands-of-educated-russians-are-moving-abroad-11649583003), [CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/12/28/europe/russian-opposition-ukraine-war-intl-cmd/index.html), [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/4/18/why-white-collar-russians-flee-two), [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/russian/features-65686712), [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/25/georgia-armenia-turkey-economies-boom-with-russian-wealth-migration.html), [Meduza](https://meduza.io/feature/2022/12/23/uehavshie-rossiyane-stali-bednee-no-zato-teper-bolshe-doveryayut-lyudyam-i-veryat-v-buduschee), [Forbes Russia](https://www.forbes.ru/forbes-woman/486866-ab-uz-slepki-kontrol-bolee-20-mln-rossian-stalkivalis-s-partnerskim-nasiliem?fbclid=IwAR0fhPrnwjVvDhSfNmFkEqGFkm4hZ7Obo-l43AkxMrDs3RK2mwwfB4M0jA4) and [The Moscow Times](https://www.moscowtimes.ru/2023/01/19/sotsialnii-portret-novoi-volni-rossiiskih-emigrantov-a31239).
